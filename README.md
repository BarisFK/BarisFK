## About Me

I am a third-year Information Systems Engineering student at Kocaeli University with a strong passion for coding and a dedication to continuous learning. Currently, my interests lie in the fields of Machine Vision, particularly with OpenCV, and Machine Learning. I have previously developed mobile and web projects, and I am eager to deepen my knowledge and skills in these areas to apply them to real-world problems.
